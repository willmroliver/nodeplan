--- NODEPLAN WORK-SCHEDULING APP ---

This project is in-progress Node/Express/MongoDB/EJS app to showcase my current skillbase.



--- CURRENT FEATURES ---

Development began two days ago, so current features are limited. Through the site, the user can:
    - View a calendar which I've hard-coded using EJS and Vanilla JS
    - Add events which are saved to a MongoDB Atlas and can be viewed on the calendar
    - Click on calendar events to see further details



--- TODO ---

The next immediate features to be added will be:
    - Add buttons to scroll through to different months on the calendar
    - Implement more functions through the MongoDB Native Driver to UPDATE and DELETE events
    - Make sensible restrictions to INSERTing new events (to avoid name-time clashes, etc.)
    - Improve Look and Feel with further CSS formatting
